1,"Source: Aboriginal Peoples Survey 2017."
2,"The target population of the 2017 Aboriginal Peoples Survey (APS) was composed of the Aboriginal identity population of Canada, 15 years of age and over as of January 15, 2017, living in private dwellings excluding persons living on Indian reserves and settlements and in certain First Nations communities in Yukon and the Northwest Territories (NWT)."
3,"Access to and use of health care services includes four components: regular medical doctor status, contact with health professional in the last 12 months, received dental care in the last three years, and health care required in the last 12 months but not received."
4,"Aboriginal identity includes persons living off reserve who reported being an Aboriginal person, that is, First Nations (North American Indian), Métis or Inuk (Inuit) and/or those who reported Registered or Treaty Indian status, that is registered under the Indian Act of Canada, and/or those who reported membership in a First Nation or Indian band. Aboriginal peoples of Canada are defined in the Constitution Act, 1982, Section 35 (2) as including the Indian, Inuit and Métis peoples of Canada. The sum of the categories included in this variable is greater than the total population estimate for Aboriginal identity because a person may have reported more than one Aboriginal identity: for example, a person could self-identify as both First Nations and Métis."
5,"This table is similar to Table <A HREF=""https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=4110000301"">41-10-0003-01</A>, which contains data from the 2012 Aboriginal Peoples Survey (APS) on access to and use of health care services. However, data users are cautioned to be aware of the differences between the variables and age ranges in Table <A HREF=""https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=4110000301"">41-10-0003-01</A> and the current table when comparing 2017 APS data with data from previous cycles."
6,"Atlantic provinces include Newfoundland and Labrador, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick."
7,"The target population of the 2017 Aboriginal Peoples Survey (APS) focused solely on the off-reserve population, excluding those living on Indian reserves and settlements and in certain First Nations communities in Yukon and Northwest Territories."
8,"The sum of the categories included in this variable does not equal the total population estimate for Aboriginal identity because a person may have reported more than one Aboriginal identity (for example, a person could have self-identified as both First Nations and Métis)."
9,"Registered or Treaty Indian status refers to whether or not a person reported being a Registered or Treaty Indian. Registered Indians are persons who are registered under the Indian Act of Canada. Treaty Indians are persons who belong to a First Nation or Indian band that signed a treaty with the Crown. Registered or Treaty Indians are sometimes also called Status Indians."
10,"""Aboriginal responses not included elsewhere"" consists of respondents who did not self-identify as Aboriginal persons but who identified as Status Indians (Registered or Treaty Indians as defined by the Indian Act of Canada) or members of a First Nation or Indian band. This is a new category for the 2017 Aboriginal Peoples Survey (APS). In 2012, persons in this category were imputed to have First Nations (North American Indian) identity."
11,"Age is derived from the respondent's date of birth and from the Aboriginal Peoples Survey reference date of January 15, 2017. The reference date corresponds approximately to the beginning of data collection for the survey."
12,"Respondents were asked: ""Do you have a regular medical doctor?""."
13,"All percentages for the component ""regular medical doctor status"" are calculated using the number of persons in ""total, regular medical doctor status"" as denominator."
14,"Respondents who said that they did not have a regular medical doctor were asked the following question: ""Why do you not have a regular medical doctor?"", followed by a list of prespecified reasons. Note: a person may have reported more than one reason for not having a regular medical doctor."
15,"Other reason(s) may include: medical doctors in the area are not taking new patients, person had a medical doctor who left or retired, or other unspecified reason."
16,"""Not specified"" categories consist of item non-response (""Refusal"", ""Don't know"", and ""Not stated"")."
17,"Respondents were asked: ""Not counting if you were an overnight patient, in the past 12 months, have you seen or talked to any of the following health professionals about your physical, emotional or mental health?"". They were then provided with a list of health professionals to which they could answer ""Yes"" or ""No"" regarding having contact in the last 12 months. Note: a person may have reported contacting more than one health professional in the last 12 months."
18,"All percentages for the component ""contact with health professional in the last 12 months"" are calculated using the number of persons in ""total, contact with health professional in the last 12 months"" as denominator."
19,"""Contact"" includes both face-to-face and telephone contact with health professionals."
20,"Dental professionals are not included among the health professionals mentioned in the list. Questions on contact with a dental professional were asked separately."
21,"Other medical doctors or specialists may include: surgeons, allergists, orthopedists, urologists, gynecologists, psychiatrists, or other unspecified health professionals."
22,"Respondents were asked: ""When was the last time that you received dental care?"" followed by a list of pre-specified time period response categories, including the response ""Never""."
23,"All percentages for the component ""received dental care in the last three years"" are calculated using the number of persons in ""total, received dental care in the last three years"" as denominator."
24,"""Received dental care"" includes only face-to-face visits with a dental professional."
25,"Includes persons who had last received dental care within the last three years but not exactly three years ago."
26,"Includes persons who had last received dental care three or more years ago, and persons who had never received dental care."
27,"Respondents were asked: ""During the past 12 months, was there ever a time when you felt that you needed health care but you didn't receive it?""."
28,"All percentages for the component ""health care required in the last 12 months but not received"" are calculated using the number of persons in ""total, health care required in the last 12 months but not received"" as denominator."
29,"Health care in this component may include dental care, depending on the respondent's interpretation of the question."
30,"Bootstrapping techniques were used to produce the coefficient of variation (CV)."
31,"Data with a coefficient of variation (CV) from 16.6% to 33.3% are identified by an (E) and should be interpreted with caution."
32,"Data with a coefficient of variation (CV) greater than 33.3% were suppressed (F) due to extreme sampling variability."
