"Note ID",Note
1,"Source: Statistics Canada, Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS)"
2,"All estimates in this table are calculated excluding non-response categories ("refusal", "don't know", and "not stated") in the denominator."
3,"The Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) excludes persons living in the Quebec Health Regions of Région du Nunavik and Région des Terres-Cries-de-la-Baie-James."
4,"Data for the Territories for the 2019-2022 reference period is taken from the pooling of data from the 2019-2020 and 2022 cycles. Data collected from respondents in the Territories in 2021 have not been released."
5,"Includes persons who reported having an Indigenous identity, that is, First Nations (North American Indian), Métis or Inuk (Inuit), or those who reported more than one identity. Excluded from the survey’s coverage are persons living on reserves and other Indigenous settlements in the provinces and territories. Data on persons reporting having multiple Indigenous identities are included in the Indigenous total but are not shown separately because of small sample sizes."
6,"Data for First Nations (North American Indian) people includes those living off reserve only."
7,"Population who reported perceiving their own health status as being either excellent or very good or fair or poor, depending on the indicator. Perceived health refers to the perception of a person's health in general, either by the person himself or herself, or, in the case of proxy response, by the person responding. Health means not only the absence of disease or injury but also physical, mental and social well-being."
8,"Population who reported perceiving their own mental health status as being excellent or very good or fair or poor, depending on the indicator. Perceived mental health refers to the perception of a person's mental health in general. Perceived mental health provides a general indication of the population suffering from some form of mental disorder, mental or emotional problems, or distress, not necessarily reflected in perceived health."
9,"Population who reported perceiving that most days in their life were quite a bit or extremely stressful. Perceived life stress refers to the amount of stress in the person's life, on most days, as perceived by the person or, in the case of proxy response, by the person responding."
10,"Body mass index (BMI) is a method of classifying body weight according to health risk. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) and Health Canada guidelines, health risk levels are associated with each of the following BMI categories: normal weight = least health risk; underweight and overweight = increased health risk; obese, class I = high health risk; obese, class II = very high health risk; obese, class III = extremely high health risk."
11,"Body mass index (BMI) is calculated by dividing the respondent's body weight (in kilograms) by their height (in metres) squared."
12,"Body mass index (BMI) is calculated for the population, excluding pregnant females and persons less than 3 feet (0.914 metres) tall or greater than 6 feet 11 inches (2.108 metres)."
13,"According to the World Health Organization (WHO) and Health Canada guidelines, the index for body weight classification for the population aged 18 and older is: less than 18.50 (underweight); 18.50 to 24.99 (normal weight); 25.00 to 29.99 (overweight); 30.00 to 34.99 (obese, class I); 35.00 to 39.99 (obese, class II); 40.00 or greater (obese, class III). The population aged 12 to 17 is classified as "severely obese", "obese", or "overweight" according to age and sex specific cut-off points defined by the World Health Organization."
14,"A systematic review of the literature concluded that the use of self-reported data among adults underestimates weight and overestimates height, resulting in lower estimates of obesity than those obtained from measured data. Using data from the 2005 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) subsample, where both measured and self-reported height and weight were collected, BMI correction equations have been developed. This table presents obesity estimates adjusted using these equations."
15,"The Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) - Annual, the Canadian Health Measures Survey (CHMS) and the 2015 CCHS - Nutrition, all collect height and weight data and derive obesity rates based on Body Mass Index (BMI). Users should take note of the data collection method, the target population and the classification system used by each survey in order to select the appropriate data set."
16,"Population who reported that they have been diagnosed by a health professional as having arthritis. Arthritis includes osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, but excludes fibromyalgia."
17,"Population who reported that they have been diagnosed by a health professional as having Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes, including females who reported that they have been diagnosed with gestational diabetes."
18,"Population who reported that they have been diagnosed by a health professional as having high blood pressure."
19,"Population who reported that they have been diagnosed by a health professional as having heart disease."
20,"Population who reported that they have been diagnosed by a health professional as suffering from the effects of a stroke."
21,"Population who reported that they have been diagnosed by a health professional as having an anxiety disorder, such as phobia, panic disorder or generalized anxiety disorder. Excludes obsessive-compulsive disorder."
22,"Population who reported that they have been diagnosed by a health professional as having a mood disorder, such as depression, bipolar disorder, mania or dysthymia."
23,"Population who reported that they currently have or have ever been diagnosed in their lifetime by a health professional as having cancer."
24,"Underlying health conditions considered include the following: obesity (self-reported body mass index greater than or equal to 30), high blood pressure, currently having cancer, currently having heart disease, suffering from the effects of a stroke, diabetes, or dementia. The number of conditions reported by each respondent was summed, for a possible total of 7."
25,"Population who reported being a current smoker. Does not take into account the number of cigarettes smoked."
26,"Data collected for this indicator is based on the question referring to smoking of cigarettes only."
27,"Daily smoker refers to those who reported smoking cigarettes every day."
28,"Statistics Canada has two main surveys that produce national and provincial smoking rates. The Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS), and the Canadian Tobacco, Alcohol and Drugs Survey (CTADS), which replaces the Canadian Tobacco Use Monitoring Survey (CTUMS) beginning in 2013. Users should be aware of a number of differences between CCHS and CTADS. CCHS collects information from respondents aged 12 and over, CTADS collects information from respondents aged 15 and over; the two surveys use different sampling frames; the annual sample for CTADS is 20,000 compared to 65,000 for CCHS; in CCHS, smoking questions are asked in the context of a wide range of health-related behaviours whereas in CTADS, all questions are related to the use of multiple products and substances with addictive properties. Although these factors can influence the estimates produced at a single point in time, the trends produced by the two surveys have been noted to be very consistent over time. Rather than comparing smoking rates produced from the two surveys, Statistics Canada advises users to choose a single source, based on their objectives, and to use that source consistently."
29,"Occasional smoker refers to those who reported smoking cigarettes occasionally. This includes former daily smokers who now smoke occasionally."
30,"Heavy drinking refers to males who reported having 5 or more drinks, or women who reported having 4 or more drinks, on one occasion, at least once a month in the past year."
31,"Population who reported that they have not have any alcoholic drinks in the past 12 months."
32,"Includes marginal, moderate and severe food insecurity. The indicator measures the household food security status which is based on a set of 18 questions. The indicator indicates whether households both with and without children were able to afford the food they needed in the previous 12 months of the survey. The levels of food security are defined as: 1- Food secure: No indication of difficulty with income-related food access; 2- Marginally food insecure: Exactly one indication of difficulty with income-related food access; 3- Moderately or severely food secure; 4- Moderately food insecure: Indication of compromise in quality and/or quantity of food consumed; 5- Severely food insecure: Indication of reduced food intake and disrupted eating patterns."
33,"Population who reported their sense of belonging to their local community as being very strong or somewhat strong. Research shows a high correlation of sense of community-belonging with physical and mental health."
34,"Population who reported being satisfied or very satisfied with their life in general. Life satisfaction is based on a self-reported score from 0 to 10 for how respondents feel about their life as a whole at the moment. Satisfied or very satisfied represents those who indicated a value of 6 or more out of 10."
35,"Population who have a health care provider they regularly see or talk to when they need normal care or advice for their health."
36,"The confidence interval illustrates the degree of variability associated with a rate. Wide confidence intervals indicate high variability, thus, these rates should be interpreted with due caution. When comparing estimates, it is important to use confidence intervals to determine if differences between values are statistically significant."
37,"Bootstrapping techniques were used to produce the 95% confidence intervals (CIs)."
40,"The following standard symbols are used in this Statistics Canada table: (..) for figures not available for a specific reference period and (...) for figures not applicable."
41,"Census population counts have been used to produce the population projection counts. These counts are used to ensure that the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) survey weights and resulting estimates included in this table are consistent with known population totals."
42,"Percentages are rounded to the nearest tenth. Numbers are rounded to the nearest hundred."
43,"Quality flags applied to percentage estimates are based on the sample size within the domain of estimation and based on the coefficient of variation (CV) for the estimated number of persons. The flag (E) signifies an estimate with poorer quality which should be used with caution. The flag (F) signifies an estimate with a quality that is too unreliable to be published. When there is no quality flag applied to the data, users should use the estimated confidence intervals as an indicator of quality for the statistics."
