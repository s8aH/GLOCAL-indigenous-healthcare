1,"Source: Aboriginal Peoples Survey 2017."
2,"The target population of the 2017 Aboriginal Peoples Survey (APS) was composed of the Aboriginal identity population of Canada, 15 years of age and over as of January 15, 2017, living in private dwellings excluding persons living on Indian reserves and settlements and in certain First Nations communities in Yukon and the Northwest Territories (NWT)."
3,"Self-perceived general health is an indicator of overall health status. Respondents were asked: ""In general, would you say your health is... Excellent? Very good? Good? Fair? Poor?""."
4,"Aboriginal identity includes persons living off reserve who reported being an Aboriginal person, that is, First Nations (North American Indian), Métis or Inuk (Inuit) and/or those who reported Registered or Treaty Indian status, that is registered under the Indian Act of Canada, and/or those who reported membership in a First Nation or Indian band. Aboriginal peoples of Canada are defined in the Constitution Act, 1982, Section 35 (2) as including the Indian, Inuit and Métis peoples of Canada. The sum of the categories included in this variable is greater than the total population estimate for Aboriginal identity because a person may have reported more than one Aboriginal identity: for example, a person could self-identify as both First Nations and Métis."
5,"This table is similar to Table <A HREF=""https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=4110000101"">41-10-0001-01</A>, which contains data from the 2001, 2006 and 2012 Aboriginal Peoples Survey (APS) on self-perceived general health. However, data users are cautioned to be aware of the differences between the variables and age ranges in Table <A HREF=""https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=4110000101"">41-10-0001-01</A> and the current table when comparing 2017 APS data with data from previous cycles."
6,"Atlantic provinces include Newfoundland and Labrador, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick."
7,"The target population of the 2017 Aboriginal Peoples Survey (APS) focused solely on the off-reserve population, excluding those living on Indian reserves and settlements and in certain First Nations communities in Yukon and Northwest Territories."
8,"The sum of the categories included in this variable does not equal the total population estimate for Aboriginal identity because a person may have reported more than one Aboriginal identity (for example, a person could have self-identified as both First Nations and Métis)."
9,"Registered or Treaty Indian status refers to whether or not a person reported being a Registered or Treaty Indian. Registered Indians are persons who are registered under the Indian Act of Canada. Treaty Indians are persons who belong to a First Nation or Indian band that signed a treaty with the Crown. Registered or Treaty Indians are sometimes also called Status Indians."
10,"""Aboriginal responses not included elsewhere"" consists of respondents who did not self-identify as Aboriginal persons but who identified as Status Indians (Registered or Treaty Indians as defined by the Indian Act of Canada) or members of a First Nation or Indian band. This is a new category for the 2017 Aboriginal Peoples Survey (APS). In 2012, persons in this category were imputed to have First Nations (North American Indian) identity."
11,"Age is derived from the respondent's date of birth and from the Aboriginal Peoples Survey reference date of January 15, 2017. The reference date corresponds approximately to the beginning of data collection for the survey."
12,"All percentages for the variable ""self-perceived general health"" are calculated using the number of persons in ""total, self-perceived general health"" as denominator."
13,"This category includes persons who rated their health as ""excellent"" or whose health was rated as ""excellent"" by someone knowledgeable about them. This is the most positive rating on the self-perceived health scale, a five-point scale ranging from ""excellent"" to ""poor""."
14,"This category includes persons who rated their health as ""very good"" or whose health was rated as ""very good"" by someone knowledgeable about them. This is one point on the self-perceived health scale, a five-point scale ranging from ""excellent"" to ""poor"". The rating ""very good"" comes between ""excellent"" and ""good""."
15,"This category includes persons who rated their health as ""good"" or whose health was rated as ""good"" by someone knowledgeable about them. This is the midpoint on the self-perceived health scale which is a five-point scale ranging from ""excellent"" to ""poor""."
16,"This category includes persons who rated their health as ""fair"" or ""poor"" or whose health was rated as ""fair"" or ""poor"" by someone knowledgeable about them. These are the most negative ratings on the self-perceived health scale, a five-point scale ranging from ""excellent"" to ""poor""."
17,"""Self-perceived general health not specified"" consists of item non-response (""Refusal"", ""Don't know"", and ""Not stated"")."
18,"Bootstrapping techniques were used to produce the coefficient of variation (CV)."
19,"Data with a coefficient of variation (CV) from 16.6% to 33.3% are identified by an (E) and should be interpreted with caution."
20,"Data with a coefficient of variation (CV) greater than 33.3% were suppressed (F) due to extreme sampling variability."
